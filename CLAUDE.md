# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new blog site project (blogサイトの立ち上げ) that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository is empty except for a README.md file.

## Getting Started

Since this is a fresh project without any code or dependencies yet, the next steps would typically involve:

1. **Choose a framework**: Consider using Next.js, Gatsby, or another static site generator for the blog
2. **Initialize the project**: Run the appropriate initialization command for the chosen framework
3. **Set up the development environment**: Install dependencies and configure the project

## Common Commands

Once the project is initialized, typical commands will depend on the chosen framework:

### For Next.js:
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` or `yarn build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` - Run linting
- `npm test` or `yarn test` - Run tests

### For Gatsby:
- `gatsby develop` - Start development server
- `gatsby build` - Build for production
- `gatsby serve` - Serve production build locally

## Architecture Notes

As this is a new project, the architecture will be established based on the chosen framework and requirements. Key considerations for a blog site typically include:

- Content management approach (MDX, CMS integration, or markdown files)
- Routing strategy for blog posts
- SEO optimization
- Performance optimization for static content
- Styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
